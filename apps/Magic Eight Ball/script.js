//Function Variables

/* The variable 'input' will get the user's input using a querySelector - a method that returns the first element within a document that matches a specified selector.  .question is the selector*/

In this instance 'ask' is the string ID that identifies the HTML button element, and will be defined as 'button' here*/

/* The variable 'output' will print one of the pre-determined responses as an answer to the user input.  .answer is the selector*/
